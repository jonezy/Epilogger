Install Instructions: (Read carefully!)

1. Disable your Network card or pull the network cable.
   And make sure you dont have any of those entries in your hosts file
   127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
   127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
   Lets start clean :)

2. Install the Master Collection CS6 with a serial generated from our keymaker ( do not close the keygen!).
When the error "Please connect to the internet and retry" shows click connect later.

3. Launch an Adobe application (Photoshop, Illustartor etc).

4. Confirm you have "connection problem" and you want it to
   activate offline.

5. A request code will be generated. Use it with the serial you used to install adobe 
   to generate your activation code.

6. Validate it of course :).

7. When installation is finished 
   Execute  disable_activation.cmd (double click on it) 
   (in Vista or Win7, run it as admin if you have uac enabled)

   Or do it manually 
   Add the text below to the bottom of your hosts file. 
   (The host file is located C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)

# Adobe Blocker

127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

8. After it has been activated re-enable you Network card and run the adobe updater to update your software to the latest version.

9. Enjoy!


Note: If you encounter any issues with a previous installation / crack, please
uninstall Master collection and delete those folders :

C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\SLCache
C:\ProgramData\Adobe\SLStore
